# My choice of values 


# Note OCI Values for interviews

## Put Customers First

> We exist to satisfy our customers. We do this by listening to them carefully, responding to them promptly, advising them honestly, and exceeding their expectations. We put doing the right thing for customers ahead of doing what they specifically say or ask for. When faced with a choice between what is easy for us and what is good for customers, customers win every time.


## Act Now, Then Iterate
> We favor action. Notice something that needs fixing? Fix it. See a gap? Fill it. Struggle with a bad process? Improve it. See room for improvement? Grow. We move quickly but deliberately, and we iterate toward better solutions. We recognize that a grungy solution now is superior to no solution at all. We keep it simple. We don't discuss endlessly, and we are scientific in our approach. We offer solutions, not problem statements.

## Expect and Embrace Change
> We accept change as a given. We value people who align quickly with current priorities, who have situational awareness, and who are willing to adapt. We are not limited to priorities we set in the past. We do not hang on to outdated processes and goals. We embrace change as an opportunity for growth and greater success. We live in the now.
 

## Innovate together 

> We practice empathy and respect in our interactions. We challenge our internal biases and learn to be more effective allies. We seek and celebrate the diverse perspectives and thought leadership that add value to our workplace, teams, and products.
We foster an inclusive environment where collaboration drives innovation. We provide the tools, processes, and resources to enable everyone to reach their full potential and find success together.


## Own Without Ego

> We take responsibility for the state of our team, our products, and ourselves. We welcome all help and feedback, and we recognize and incorporate the best ideas offered. We are the first to admit when we are wrong. We recognize that our team can produce far more than we can as lone individuals. When we notice a problem we either fix it ourselves or find another owner. We never say, “That’s not my job.”

## Earn Trust, Give Trust

> We build trust by communicating openly and transparently. We give trust easily, and we recognize that trusting each other is essential to our success. We act responsibly, and we trust others to also be responsible. We don't let occasional failures and differences in work styles undermine our trust. We learn from failures rather than seeking to place blame.


## Take Risks, Remain Calm

> We take risks because they are necessary to our success; not taking risks is the biggest risk of all. We are logical and data-driven in assessing our risks. We react to unexpected situations by remaining calm, and then making and executing mitigation plans. We recognize that learning from our failures is part of our path to success.

## Take Pride in Your Work
> We strive for excellence in all that we do, and we take pride in our progress. We do our best when we are proud of what we do. We identify work that needs to be done to achieve our team goals. We take responsibility for either changing our work or changing ourselves when we don’t find pride in our work. We invest broadly in things that allow us to excel at our jobs, dominate in the marketplace, and delight our customers. We achieve things of value, and we value our achievements.

## Nail the Basics

We focus on fundamentals over flash. We recognize when we don’t have the basics in place, and we diligently work to fill the gaps. We recognize that the path to advanced solutions always runs through the basics. We focus our conversations and our products on what is currently appropriate. We make forward progress despite not having complete information or perfect solutions.

## Challenge ideas, champion execution

We ask why. We test the validity of ideas through rigor, research, and critical thinking. We have an obligation to create clarity for ourselves and others. We own decisions. We drive effective implementation.
