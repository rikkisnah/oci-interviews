# Past Projects/Initiatives Delivers (And Lessons From Failed Ones)

**STAR 1: Data Retention Compliance Issue**
- **Situation:** Led QA for cloud-connected metal detector system with sensitive data handling requirements across multiple hardware/software versions
- **Task:** Discovered critical data retention issue exceeding 30-day regulatory limit that went unnoticed, creating compliance risk
- **Action:** Escalated issue up management chain to ensure ownership, worked with dev team on fix, built comprehensive automation framework to test all permutations of HW/SW combinations, validated performance post-fix
- **Result:** Prevented major regulatory compliance violation, established automated validation process for all future releases, learned importance of clear ownership for critical issues

**STAR 2: Hardware Validation Innovation** 
- **Situation:** Needed to test full metal detector pipeline but couldn't use actual metal objects due to safety/practical constraints
- **Task:** Create solution to validate hardware detection through entire software stack including RF interference challenges
- **Action:** Built Arduino-based fan contraption to simulate electromagnetic signatures, developed incremental testing approach starting with physical presence debugging, created 3D simulation for object injection at different planes/orientations
- **Result:** Enabled comprehensive hardware testing at scale, shipped products with iterative improvements, validated complex mesh network performance (fan-out vs power degradation)

**STAR 3: Cross-Team Collaboration Framework**
- **Situation:** Siloed teams (QA, Dev, Product, Threat Detection) causing missed bugs and delayed fixes
- **Task:** Break down silos and improve bug detection/resolution efficiency
- **Action:** Invited product managers into bug scrubs, built heatmaps and galleries to visualize threat detection misses, created shared dashboards for cross-team visibility
- **Result:** Improved model accuracy downstream, reduced bug escape rate, established collaborative culture

**Lessons from Failures:**
- Initially pushed tools without ensuring adoption - learned to secure buy-in and engagement before scaling solutions
- Recognized that some past "complex" solutions now seem simplistic with technology advances - stays humble and continues learning

# My choice of values 

## Put Customers First
Alex consistently frames problems from customer/end-user impact perspective. Example: treating data retention issue as trust and compliance risk even though never shipped. Built visualization tools (heatmaps/galleries) to help downstream teams improve threat detection models. Always validates that solutions meet actual customer needs beyond just technical requirements.

## Act Now, Then Iterate  
Demonstrated through hardware testing approach - started with basic fan contraption, then iterated to more sophisticated 3D simulations. When faced with RF interference challenges, delivered initial solution requiring physical presence, then improved remotely. Philosophy of "automation-first" but willing to start manual when needed.

## Own Without Ego
Takes full ownership of QA outcomes regardless of formal role boundaries. When finding critical issues, ensures ownership exists even if requiring escalation. Admits gaps in knowledge, learns from shortcomings. Transitioned from manager to IC willingly to stay hands-on. First to acknowledge when past approaches didn't work.

## Innovate Together
Strong cross-functional collaborator across QA, Dev, Product, ATD teams. Breaks down silos by bringing teams together in bug scrubs. Builds shared tools and visualizations to enable collective problem-solving. Values diverse perspectives in solving complex hardware/software interaction problems.

## Take Risks, Remain Calm  
Comfortable working in ambiguous situations with incomplete information. When standard testing approaches failed, took risk building unconventional solutions (Arduino fan test). Remained calm when discovering critical compliance issue late in process, focused on mitigation rather than blame.

# Note OCI Values for interviews

## Put Customers First

> We exist to satisfy our customers. We do this by listening to them carefully, responding to them promptly, advising them honestly, and exceeding their expectations. We put doing the right thing for customers ahead of doing what they specifically say or ask for. When faced with a choice between what is easy for us and what is good for customers, customers win every time.


## Act Now, Then Iterate
> We favor action. Notice something that needs fixing? Fix it. See a gap? Fill it. Struggle with a bad process? Improve it. See room for improvement? Grow. We move quickly but deliberately, and we iterate toward better solutions. We recognize that a grungy solution now is superior to no solution at all. We keep it simple. We don't discuss endlessly, and we are scientific in our approach. We offer solutions, not problem statements.

## Expect and Embrace Change
> We accept change as a given. We value people who align quickly with current priorities, who have situational awareness, and who are willing to adapt. We are not limited to priorities we set in the past. We do not hang on to outdated processes and goals. We embrace change as an opportunity for growth and greater success. We live in the now.
 

## Innovate together 

> We practice empathy and respect in our interactions. We challenge our internal biases and learn to be more effective allies. We seek and celebrate the diverse perspectives and thought leadership that add value to our workplace, teams, and products.
We foster an inclusive environment where collaboration drives innovation. We provide the tools, processes, and resources to enable everyone to reach their full potential and find success together.


## Own Without Ego

> We take responsibility for the state of our team, our products, and ourselves. We welcome all help and feedback, and we recognize and incorporate the best ideas offered. We are the first to admit when we are wrong. We recognize that our team can produce far more than we can as lone individuals. When we notice a problem we either fix it ourselves or find another owner. We never say, "That's not my job."

## Earn Trust, Give Trust

> We build trust by communicating openly and transparently. We give trust easily, and we recognize that trusting each other is essential to our success. We act responsibly, and we trust others to also be responsible. We don't let occasional failures and differences in work styles undermine our trust. We learn from failures rather than seeking to place blame.


## Take Risks, Remain Calm

> We take risks because they are necessary to our success; not taking risks is the biggest risk of all. We are logical and data-driven in assessing our risks. We react to unexpected situations by remaining calm, and then making and executing mitigation plans. We recognize that learning from our failures is part of our path to success.

## Take Pride in Your Work
> We strive for excellence in all that we do, and we take pride in our progress. We do our best when we are proud of what we do. We identify work that needs to be done to achieve our team goals. We take responsibility for either changing our work or changing ourselves when we don't find pride in our work. We invest broadly in things that allow us to excel at our jobs, dominate in the marketplace, and delight our customers. We achieve things of value, and we value our achievements.

## Nail the Basics

We focus on fundamentals over flash. We recognize when we don't have the basics in place, and we diligently work to fill the gaps. We recognize that the path to advanced solutions always runs through the basics. We focus our conversations and our products on what is currently appropriate. We make forward progress despite not having complete information or perfect solutions.

## Challenge ideas, champion execution

We ask why. We test the validity of ideas through rigor, research, and critical thinking. We have an obligation to create clarity for ourselves and others. We own decisions. We drive effective implementation.
